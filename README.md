## Introduction
Rainfall prediction plays a crucial role in various sectors such as agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness. Accurate prediction of rainfall can help farmers plan their crop cultivation, aid in effective water resource allocation, and mitigate the impact of natural disasters. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict rainfall based on historical weather data.

## Problem Statement
Given historical weather data including features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure, the goal is to predict the amount of rainfall. The model should be able to accurately forecast rainfall for different time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) and geographical locations.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains historical weather data collected from various weather stations. It includes features such as:
- Date and time
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- Atmospheric pressure
- Rainfall (target variable)

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the distribution of features, identify correlations, and gain insights into the data.
3. **Feature Selection**: Select relevant features that contribute most to predicting rainfall.
4. **Model Selection**: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared score.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune hyperparameters of the best-performing models to improve performance.
7. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model to make real-time rainfall predictions.

## Files
1) rainfall_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
2) data/: Directory containing the dataset files.
3) requirements.txt: File listing all Python dependencies.

## Results
We will present detailed results including model performance metrics, feature importance, and insights gained from EDA.

## Future Work
Potential areas for future work include:

Incorporating additional features such as geographical information and satellite data.
Implementing advanced machine learning techniques such as neural networks for rainfall prediction.
Developing a user interface for easy access to real-time rainfall forecasts.
